# Annotator3K
Java OOP

It is an easy and intuitive program based on Java with the main feature of adding annotations.
However, it can not add annotations to every type of files, it has been programmed to add those only on images. The user is able to add as many annotations he wants to particular locations on the image and save them. Besides, this annotation can be removed eventually by the user. 
In addition to these previous features, if the user chooses a non-picture file, he will get a warning message in the console informing about the error, and the program will close automatically. 
At the time that the image has been displayed, the UI itself will resize in order to fit the image.
